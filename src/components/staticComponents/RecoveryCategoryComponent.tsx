            <div className="sub_heading">WHAT IS GLUTAMINE?</div>
            <div className="para">
                Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid that is abundantly present in the body. It plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including protein synthesis, immune function, and intestinal health.

            <div className="sub_heading">BENEFITS OF GLUTAMINE SUPPLEMENTS:</div>
            <div className="para">
                Glutamine supplements offer several benefits, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Promoting muscle recovery: Glutamine helps reduce muscle soreness and speeds up the recovery process after intense exercise by replenishing glycogen stores and supporting muscle protein synthesis.</li>
                    <li>Boosting immune function: Glutamine is a vital nutrient for immune cells, helping to strengthen the body's defense against infections and illnesses.</li>
                    <li>Supporting gut health: Glutamine plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal lining, which is essential for proper digestion and nutrient absorption.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <div className="sub_heading">WHEN TO TAKE GLUTAMINE SUPPLEMENTS:</div>
            <div className="para">
                Glutamine supplements can be taken at any time of the day, but they are commonly consumed before or after workouts to support muscle recovery. They can also be taken before bed to enhance overnight recovery and reduce muscle breakdown during sleep.
            </div>


            <div className="sub_heading">RECOMMENDED DOSAGE OF GLUTAMINE:</div>
            <div className="para">
                The recommended dosage of glutamine supplements typically ranges from 5 to 15 grams per day, depending on individual needs and goals. It is best to start with a lower dosage and gradually increase it based on tolerance and desired results.

            <div className="main_heading">CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS</div>
            <div className="sub_heading">WHAT IS CREATINE?</div>
            <div className="para">
                Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells, where it serves as a rapid source of energy during high-intensity activities such as weightlifting and sprinting. It is also obtained through dietary sources such as meat and fish.
            </div>


            <div className="sub_heading">BENEFITS OF CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS:</div>
            <div className="para">
                Creatine supplements offer several benefits, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased muscle strength and power: Creatine supplementation has been shown to enhance strength, power, and performance during resistance training and high-intensity exercise.</li>
                    <li>Improved muscle recovery: Creatine helps replenish ATP (adenosine triphosphate) stores in muscles, allowing for faster recovery between sets and workouts.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced muscle growth: By increasing ATP availability, creatine supplementation can stimulate muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle hypertrophy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <div className="sub_heading">HOW TO TAKE CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS:</div>
            <div className="para">
                Creatine supplements are typically taken in two main ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Loading phase: During the loading phase, individuals consume around 20 grams of creatine per day for 5-7 days to saturate muscle stores quickly.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance phase: After the loading phase, a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams per day is usually sufficient to maintain elevated creatine levels in the muscles.</li>
                </ul>
                Creatine can be mixed with water or juice and consumed before or after workouts for optimal results.

            <div className="sub_heading">POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF CREATINE:</div>
            <div className="para">
                While creatine is generally considered safe for most people when taken as directed, some individuals may experience side effects such as stomach discomfort, bloating, or dehydration. It is important to stay hydrated and consult with a healthcare professional before starting creatine supplementation, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.
