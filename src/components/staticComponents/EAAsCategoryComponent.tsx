            <div className="para">
                Essential Amino Acids (EAAs) are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 types of amino acids, out of which 9 are essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body. These amino acids must be obtained through dietary sources or supplements. EAA supplements contain all nine essential amino acids in a balanced and precise amount.

            <div className="sub_heading">ROLE OF EAA IN MUSCLE GROWTH AND REPAIR:</div>
            <div className="para">
                EAA supplements are essential for muscle growth and recovery. They play a crucial role in the process of muscle protein synthesis, which is the creation of new muscle proteins. When we train our muscles, we create microscopic tears in muscle fibers. These tears can only be repaired if there are enough amino acids available in the body to synthesize new muscle proteins. EAA supplements provide the necessary amino acids required for muscle protein synthesis, thus aiding in muscle growth.

            <div className="sub_heading">BENEFITS OF EAA SUPPLEMENTS:</div>
            <div className="para">One of the biggest benefits of EAA supplements is their convenience. EAA supplements are available in powder form and can easily be mixed with water or any other beverage. They can also be consumed at any time, unlike whole foods that need to be timed properly around workouts. Additionally, EAA supplements are easily absorbed by the body, making them a quick and efficient source of amino acids.</div>


            <div className="sub_heading">RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND TIMING FOR EAA INTAKE:</div>
            <div className="para">
                The recommended dosage of EAA supplements varies depending on the individual's body weight, fitness goals, and dietary intake. Generally, it is recommended to consume 5-10 grams of EAA per day. It is best to consume EAA supplements during or after a workout when the body is in need of amino acids for muscle protein synthesis.
